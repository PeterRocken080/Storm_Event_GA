The tornado tracked across Interstate-75 at mile marker 348 then continued on into and through the city of Ringgold before tracking northeast toward Cohutta and then into Hamilton and eventually Bradley county, Tennessee.  The tornado tracked nearly 12 miles through Catoosa county.  Major devastation was observed throughout the north side of the city of Ringgold.  The worst damage occurred on Cherokee Valley Road on the north side of Ringgold where 12 homes were obliterated.  An additional 80 to 90 homes sustained major damage from the tornado.  In addition, several commercial businesses, including restaurants and motels, at exit 348 on Interstate-75 were destroyed.  There were eight fatalities and 30 injuries reported with this tornado.  Seven of the eight deaths occurred on Cherokee Valley Road, which was heavily devastated by the tornado.  Most of the tornado victims lived within 200 yards of each other and were killed when their homes collapsed around them.  Finally, hundreds of trees and dozens of power lines and utility poles were also destroyed by the tornado.  This was by far the deadliest and most devastating of the 15 tornadoes to affect north and central Georgia during this tornado outbreak.||Total damages from Catoosa county consist of 74 destroyed homes and/or businesses, 60 with major damage, and 118 with minor damage for a total of 252 affected structures.||[04/27-04/28/11: Tornado #4, County #1-1, EF4, Catoosa, 2011:013].","A highly diffluent, deep upper trough, centered across Texas, took on a negative tilt and began to rotate northeast during this period.  A strong maritime-Pacific (mP) cold front accompanied the upper trough through the mid-south into the southeast from the early morning hours of the 27th to the early morning hours of the 28th.  An intense low-level jet with winds in excess of 70 knots was noted in advance of this system and tracked across the mid-south early on the 27th, across north Alabama and north Georgia into the early morning hours of the 28th.  West-southwest winds aloft were highly diffluent and near 200 mph across this same region.  The strong low-level jet brought unseasonably, warm, moist Gulf air northward in advance of the mP cold front.  Dewpoints in the 70s and maximum temperatures in the 80s combined with the extremely strong low-level and upper jets to create an almost perfect environment for severe thunderstorms and large devastating tornadoes.  Indeed, the tornado outbreak that affected much of the eastern U.S., but particularly the south central and southeastern U.S. during this period, was unprecedented and likely the largest recorded in U.S. history.  The tornado outbreak that accompanied this combination of weather features has been termed the 2011 Super Outbreak, an outbreak even worse than the 1994 and 1974 super tornado outbreaks across the eastern U.S.  The outbreak affected the South Central, Southeast, Midwest, and even the usually less tornado prone Northeastern United States.  Over 330 tornadoes were reported during this outbreak which began on April 25th and continued into the 28th affecting 21 states from Texas to New York.  Even isolated tornadoes were noted in Canada.  Nearly 350 people died from these tornadoes, of which over 230 of these were in Alabama alone.  Four tornadoes on April 27th in Alabama and Mississippi were ranked EF5, the highest tornado damage rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  On average, there is only one EF5 tornado per year in the entire U.S.||Widespread and destructive tornadoes occurred on each day of the outbreak, but April 27th was clearly one of the most prolific and destructive tornado days in U.S. history, probably only surpassed by the Tri-State outbreak of 1925 and the Tupelo-Gainesville outbreak of 1936.  The 24-hour period from 8 am April 27th to 8 a.m. April 28th is listed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as the fourth deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history, with the 24 hours commencing April 28th at 8 a.m. as the fifth deadliest tornado day in U.S. history.  It has also been determined to be the costliest tornado outbreaks and one of the costliest natural disasters in the U.S., even after adjustments for inflation, with total damages estimated to exceed $10 billion. ||Georgia was heavily impacted by this tornado outbreak, especially the northwest part of the state which bore the brunt of the massive supercell thunderstorms producing killer tornadoes that tracked east-northeast from northern Alabama during the late evening.  All together, there were 15 tornadoes affecting 28 counties within the Peachtree City, Georgia 96-county warning area (CWA) of North and Central Georgia.  All of these occurred within a 24-hour period commencing at 8 am April 27th.  One of these tornadoes was rated an EF4, the first EF4 tornado in Georgia since the Palm Sunday outbreak in 1994.  In addition, there were also four EF3 tornadoes.  Fifteen tornado-related deaths were observed in north and central Georgia, the most tornado-related deaths within the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area since its inception in 1994.  The previous highest tornado-related death total was 12 on March 20, 1998, when a tornado struck Gainesville, Georgia.||Finally, it should be noted that while the most significant period of severe weather during this outbreak for Georgia was from the afternoon of the 27th through the early morning hours of the 28th, there was an initial round of severe weather across northwest Georgia early on the 27th as a decaying line of severe thunderstorms moved into the region from northeast Alabama.  Widespread wind damage and even a few brief weaker tornadoes accompanied this system into the northwest counties of the state.",4,244,,

The tornado touched down along Mitchell Bridge Road, just northwest of the Indian Trace Golf Course where several trees were snapped. The tornado moved northeast crossing Highway 286 and Twin Lakes Road where a few trees were snapped or uprooted and|minor damage occurred to several homes. The tornado appeared to briefly strengthen around Ellis Circle where there was more notable exterior damage to homes and a greater number of trees uprooted. As the tornado continued northeast crossing Fullers Chapel Road, noticeable strengthening occurred. Aerial drone footage showed a wide swath of large trees blown down just before Norton Bridge Road. At least 8 double-wide manufactured homes were completely destroyed along Deer Park Drive, with several others sustaining some degree of damage. It was here the tornado quickly strengthened to EF2 intensity with winds around 125 MPH. Similar, significant, damage was seen along Ridgeview Lane and Fieldview Court, where additional manufactured homes were destroyed and a recently built cell tower was left crumpled by the intense winds. At this point, the tornado reached its peak intensity with maximum wind speeds around 135 MPH. The tornado maintained its EF2 intensity as it crossed over Zion Church Hill Road, just before Highway 225. As the strong tornado crossed Highway 225, a small single-family home was heavily damaged with just a couple of interior walls left standing. Along Jim Petty Road, 4 large chicken houses were damaged or destroyed with the debris thrown several hundred yards away.  Further north along Jim Petty Road, near Hawkins Road, the damage appeared to lessen quickly with just a few trees blown down and minor roof damage to a shed. Some additional damage, mainly trees being snapped or uprooted, was seen along Halls Chapel Road, just before Temple Grove road. The tornado lifted just beyond this point, along Sumac Ridge. Eight people were killed and around 2 dozen injured in the area between Fullers Chapel Road and Jim Petty Road.

The tornado path length within Dade county, Georgia was approximately 9.5 miles, while the path length within Georgia was 18 miles long.  The tornado was determined, within Georgia, to have a maximum path width of 0.6 mile and maximum winds of 150 mph.  The tornado tracked directly across the county seat of Dade county, namely Trenton.  Trenton is also the largest city in Dade county.  Portions of Trenton, especially the southern part of the city, were literally destroyed.  Dozens of homes were completely destroyed.  Eighteen more homes suffered major damage.  Literally tens of thousands of trees were blown down, uprooted, or splintered.  Some of the worst devastation was observed in the Black Valley Road area, including the Middleton Estates subdivision and along U.S. Highway 11 and Georgia Highway 136.  Considerable damage was also noted to apartments and several commercial buildings as well.  The Edgewood Townhouses and Village Green Apartments suffered extensive damage.  Among commercial structures sustaining damages were the Moore and Ryan Funeral Home along with an Ingles Grocery Store.  Two fatalities and 25 injuries occurred as a result of this tornado, mostly in Trenton.||[04/27-04/28/11:  Tornado #2, County #1-2, EF2, Dade-Walker, 2011:011].","A highly diffluent, deep upper trough, centered across Texas, took on a negative tilt and began to rotate northeast during this period.  A strong maritime-Pacific (mP) cold front accompanied the upper trough through the mid-south into the southeast from the early morning hours of the 27th to the early morning hours of the 28th.  An intense low-level jet with winds in excess of 70 knots was noted in advance of this system and tracked across the mid-south early on the 27th, across north Alabama and north Georgia into the early morning hours of the 28th.  West-southwest winds aloft were highly diffluent and near 200 mph across this same region.  The strong low-level jet brought unseasonably, warm, moist Gulf air northward in advance of the mP cold front.  Dewpoints in the 70s and maximum temperatures in the 80s combined with the extremely strong low-level and upper jets to create an almost perfect environment for severe thunderstorms and large devastating tornadoes.  Indeed, the tornado outbreak that affected much of the eastern U.S., but particularly the south central and southeastern U.S. during this period, was unprecedented and likely the largest recorded in U.S. history.  The tornado outbreak that accompanied this combination of weather features has been termed the 2011 Super Outbreak, an outbreak even worse than the 1994 and 1974 super tornado outbreaks across the eastern U.S.  The outbreak affected the South Central, Southeast, Midwest, and even the usually less tornado prone Northeastern United States.  Over 330 tornadoes were reported during this outbreak which began on April 25th and continued into the 28th affecting 21 states from Texas to New York.  Even isolated tornadoes were noted in Canada.  Nearly 350 people died from these tornadoes, of which over 230 of these were in Alabama alone.  Four tornadoes on April 27th in Alabama and Mississippi were ranked EF5, the highest tornado damage rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  On average, there is only one EF5 tornado per year in the entire U.S.||Widespread and destructive tornadoes occurred on each day of the outbreak, but April 27th was clearly one of the most prolific and destructive tornado days in U.S. history, probably only surpassed by the Tri-State outbreak of 1925 and the Tupelo-Gainesville outbreak of 1936.  The 24-hour period from 8 am April 27th to 8 a.m. April 28th is listed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as the fourth deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history, with the 24 hours commencing April 28th at 8 a.m. as the fifth deadliest tornado day in U.S. history.  It has also been determined to be the costliest tornado outbreaks and one of the costliest natural disasters in the U.S., even after adjustments for inflation, with total damages estimated to exceed $10 billion. ||Georgia was heavily impacted by this tornado outbreak, especially the northwest part of the state which bore the brunt of the massive supercell thunderstorms producing killer tornadoes that tracked east-northeast from northern Alabama during the late evening.  All together, there were 15 tornadoes affecting 28 counties within the Peachtree City, Georgia 96-county warning area (CWA) of North and Central Georgia.  All of these occurred within a 24-hour period commencing at 8 am April 27th.  One of these tornadoes was rated an EF4, the first EF4 tornado in Georgia since the Palm Sunday outbreak in 1994.  In addition, there were also four EF3 tornadoes.  Fifteen tornado-related deaths were observed in north and central Georgia, the most tornado-related deaths within the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area since its inception in 1994.  The previous highest tornado-related death total was 12 on March 20, 1998, when a tornado struck Gainesville, Georgia.||Finally, it should be noted that while the most significant period of severe weather during this outbreak for Georgia was from the afternoon of the 27th through the early morning hours of the 28th, there was an initial round of severe weather across northwest Georgia early on the 27th as a decaying line of severe thunderstorms moved into the region from northeast Alabama.

The tornado tracked a total distance on the ground of approximately 40 miles.  The tornado entered Sumter county about 4.75 miles southwest of Plains in southwest Sumter county and exited the northeast part of the county about 9 miles north of Methvins in northeast Sumter county.  This was by far the most violent and devastating tornado of the March 1st outbreak.  The tornado tracked roughly 32 miles across Sumter county with a maximum path width of 1.0 mile wide, which occurred in the Americus area.  Damage within the city of Americus was extensive, although structures, trees, and power lines were down along the entire path of the tornado.  The most significant damage in Americus was to the Sumter Regional Hospital, of which a significant portion was destroyed.  Hundreds of homes and businesses in the Americus area were either totally destroyed or sustained significant damage.  Hunderds of vehicles were also damaged or destroyed by debris and/or tossed about like matchsticks.  The majority of the damage was within the vicinity of the Sumter Regional Hospital.

A 150kt jet was located over the region at 250mb with a strong 50kt low-level jet from central Alabama into central Tennessee.  A wedge of cool air was present over much of north central and northeast Georgia. Rain, which spread over this area early in the day, helped enhance the wedge of cool air.  Little to no severe weather was noted north of the wedge boundary across north Georgia where the air mass remained relatively cool and stable. Meanwhile...a warm, humid air mass was present across much of central and south Georgia where dewpoints had risen well into the 60s during the afternoon.  The strong upper dynamics present over this region combined with the instability just south of the wedge provided a very favorable environment for long lived, strong tornadoes.  A total of 14 tornadoes affecting 17 counties tracked across central and east central Georgia and within the Peachtree City, Georgia county warning area during the late afternoon and evening hours of March 1st.

The activity tracked east-southeast with the upper flow aloft, mainly across north Georgia during the early morning and across central Georgia during the afternoon.  An isolated strong supercell also tracked across the southern part of central Georgia during the evening.  After a lull of convective activity for about four hours, intense multicell thunderstorms tracked into the area from Alabama after midnight and before dawn on the 11th.  As these thunderstorms tracked across west central and central Georgia, 15 tornadoes were identified by subsequent surveys making this the most significant tornado outbreak to affect the area since the Katrina-associated tornadoes on August 29, 2005.  Millions of dollars of property damage were reported as many homes were destroyed from these tornadoes from the western and southern suburbs of Atlanta southeastward across Macon, Dublin, and other counties in east central and southeast Georgia.  Many of these counties were eligible for disaster assistance from the federal government.||In addition to the tornadoes and thunderstorm winds that caused extensive damage in dozens of counties across north and central Georgia during the early morning hours of May 11th, strong gradient winds developed on the back side of the strong cold front that moved through the area as low pressure intensified across the mid-Atlantic region.

The strong low-level jet brought unseasonably, warm, moist Gulf air northward in advance of the mP cold front.  Dewpoints in the 70s and maximum temperatures in the 80s combined with the extremely strong low-level and upper jets to create an almost perfect environment for severe thunderstorms and large devastating tornadoes.  Indeed, the tornado outbreak that affected much of the eastern U.S., but particularly the south central and southeastern U.S. during this period, was unprecedented and likely the largest recorded in U.S. history.  The tornado outbreak that accompanied this combination of weather features has been termed the 2011 Super Outbreak, an outbreak even worse than the 1994 and 1974 super tornado outbreaks across the eastern U.S.  The outbreak affected the South Central, Southeast, Midwest, and even the usually less tornado prone Northeastern United States.  Over 330 tornadoes were reported during this outbreak which began on April 25th and continued into the 28th affecting 21 states from Texas to New York.  Even isolated tornadoes were noted in Canada.  Nearly 350 people died from these tornadoes, of which over 230 of these were in Alabama alone.  Four tornadoes on April 27th in Alabama and Mississippi were ranked EF5, the highest tornado damage rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  On average, there is only one EF5 tornado per year in the entire U.S.||Widespread and destructive tornadoes occurred on each day of the outbreak, but April 27th was clearly one of the most prolific and destructive tornado days in U.S. history, probably only surpassed by the Tri-State outbreak of 1925 and the Tupelo-Gainesville outbreak of 1936.  The 24-hour period from 8 am April 27th to 8 a.m. April 28th is listed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as the fourth deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history, with the 24 hours commencing April 28th at 8 a.m. as the fifth deadliest tornado day in U.S. history.  It has also been determined to be the costliest tornado outbreaks and one of the costliest natural disasters in the U.S., even after adjustments for inflation, with total damages estimated to exceed $10 billion. ||Georgia was heavily impacted by this tornado outbreak, especially the northwest part of the state which bore the brunt of the massive supercell thunderstorms producing killer tornadoes that tracked east-northeast from northern Alabama during the late evening.  All together, there were 15 tornadoes affecting 28 counties within the Peachtree City, Georgia 96-county warning area (CWA) of North and Central Georgia.  All of these occurred within a 24-hour period commencing at 8 am April 27th.  One of these tornadoes was rated an EF4, the first EF4 tornado in Georgia since the Palm Sunday outbreak in 1994.  In addition, there were also four EF3 tornadoes.  Fifteen tornado-related deaths were observed in north and central Georgia, the most tornado-related deaths within the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area since its inception in 1994.  The previous highest tornado-related death total was 12 on March 20, 1998, when a tornado struck Gainesville, Georgia.||Finally, it should be noted that while the most significant period of severe weather during this outbreak for Georgia was from the afternoon of the 27th through the early morning hours of the 28th, there was an initial round of severe weather across northwest Georgia early on the 27th as a decaying line of severe thunderstorms moved into the region from northeast Alabama.  Widespread wind damage and even a few brief weaker tornadoes accompanied this system into the northwest counties of the state.",36,244,,

The tornado touched down at EF-1 strength in northern Brooks County near Georgia Route 122 just west of the Moultrie Highway, snapping trees along the highway. Near the intersection of Georgia Route 133, or the Valdosta Highway, the tornado strengthened to EF-3 blowing out two of the four concrete walls of a small business building. Max winds were estimated near 140 mph.  A short distance later, the tornado flipped a strapped-down double wide mobile home and tossed it about 100 feet into a drainage ditch and across Route 122. Two people inside the home were killed. Several nearby trees had their bark stripped off. The tornado then crossed Georgia Route 76 at EF-3 strength and ripped about a third of the second story from a well-built brick home. A short distance up the road, the tornado shifted a wood-framed home about 12 feet off its foundation while removing its second story.  This tornado then continued into Cook and Berrien counties.  Damage cost was estimated.","A multi-day severe weather event struck the southeast January 21-22, 2017 with three rounds of severe weather moving through the area. The first round of severe weather started during the mid-morning hours on Saturday, January 21, 2017 as a squall line pushed into southeast Alabama and the Florida panhandle. As it pushed eastward nine warnings were issued with a total of 18 damaging wind reports (trees and power lines downed) related to these storms. ||After a brief lull during Saturday evening as the aforementioned squall line washed out near the Gulf Coast, strong southerly flow returned late Saturday night as a warm front pushed northward across the Florida Big Bend and southern Georgia.

This was the first tornado across the area with this multi- day event. From the same supercell that produced the tornado in Thomas and northern Brooks Counties, another tornado developed that tracked across Brooks, Berrien and Cook Counties and this tornado resulted in 11 fatalities. This overnight into early Sunday morning event produced one more tornado, an EF-1 that struck Lowndes County. ||A final round of severe weather moved through Sunday afternoon as a warm front continued to push northward into southeast Alabama and southern Georgia while the main low and trailing cold front pushed eastward across the Florida panhandle and offshore regions. This afternoon round of supercells first produced a tornado in Henry County, AL. An hour and a half after the Henry County tornado, two more tornadoes developed, an EF-2 that struck Clay, Randolph and Calhoun Counties (Georgia) and an EF-1 tornado that hit Franklin County, FL. After this, a long tracked tornado (track length of more than 70 miles) moved across Albany (Dougherty County) and into Worth and Turner Counties, causing extensive damage and five fatalities. ||Overall this multi-day event resulted in seven tornadoes, 16 deaths and numerous injuries.

The tornado also resulted in one death and 30 non-life threatening injuries.  The death occurred on Decatur Street across from the Martin Luther King MARTA station.||The tornado first touched down near the intersection of Simpson and Burbank Streets in the Vine City neighborhood just west of downtown Atlanta.  The tornado then tracked near due east over the center of the Georgia World Congress Center, about 100 yards north of the Georgia Dome, which was concurrently hosting an SEC basketball conference, across the CNN Omni Hotel Complex and the Phillips Arena, where an NBA basketball game was underway, across the Equitable Bank tower, across the Interstate 75/85 Downtown Connector at the Edgewood Exit, and then into the Cotton Mill Lofts across the Oakland Cemetery located near the Fulton/DeKalb county line.  The tornado then weakened, but continued into extreme western DeKalb county before finally lifting for good.||The tornado had a total path length of six miles, five of which fell within Fulton county, and a maximum path width of 200 yards.  Maximum wind speeds were estimated at 130 mph, which is a high end EF2.  The tornado had a path width of 100 yards as it moved across the Georgia World Congress Center and CNN Omni Hotel complex and was ranked an EF1 at that point.||At least 50 homes were damaged by the tornado, as were several multi-story towers and commercial buildings near and east of Centennial Olympic Park.  Windows were blown out of several of these high rise tower buildings at multiple heights.  Damage in residential and industrial areas ranged from roofing materials blown from homes and businesses to trees falling on structures and vehicles.  The Cotton Mill Lofts experienced some of the most significant damage with the roof blown off and exterior walls on the top or fourth floors blown inward.  Two sections of the fourth flour collapsed all the way into the basement of the building, trapping several people.

The violent tornado began just west of the Bryan County Courthouse in Pembroke, where it damaged part of the roof, blew out some windows, and snapped numerous trees. The tornado continued along a northeast path across a wooded, marshy area, including C C Road, Stubbs Farm Road, and Stubby Road. In this area, the tornado produced significant tree damage, and heavily damaged a residence on Stubbs Farm Road. The tornado then continued east-northeast moving through Hendrix Park, Park Place subdivision, and Black Creek Golf Course, where it reached a maximum width of 3/4 of a mile and peak EF-4 intensity. Across this area, the tornado extensively damaged most homes, structures and trees. Some homes and structures were completely destroyed. Several injuries, some serious, occurred in this area as well. The tornado then continued east-northeast over wooded and marshy areas, across Olive Branch Road and across the southern end of Homestead Drive. Several mobile homes were completely destroyed in this area, causing additional injuries and tragically claiming the life of an adult female. The tornado began to weaken as it moved toward the interchange of I-16 and U.S. Highway 280. In this area, there was some minor roof damage to a large industrial building off of Oracal Parkway Circle, as well as some snapping and uprooting of trees. The tornado finally dissipated in a marshy region just east of Oracal Parkway Circle.","A severe quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) moved through southeast Georgia during the afternoon into early evening hours of April 5, 2022 as a mid-level shortwave ejected rapidly across the region in advance of a surface cold front. The environment ahead of the QLCS was favorable for severe local storms as southerly winds spread mid 60 dewpoint temperatures into a warm sector across the Southeast United States and favorable mid-level lapse rates and lifted index values helped produce mixed layer convective available potential energy (MLCAPE) as high as 1500-2000 J/kg during peak surface heating across southeast Georgia. Within the warm sector, strong shear associated with 50-70 knot low and mid-level jets beneath the left front quadrant of a 120 knot upper-level jet, 0-6 km bulk shear around 50 knots, and 0-3 km storm relative helicity in excess of 300 m2/s2 were supportive of well organized convection and potentially embedded supercell thunderstorms in a QLCS capable of producing a prolonged path of damaging winds and strong long-track tornadoes. As the QLCS swept through southeast Georgia, a few discrete supercell thunderstorms became exceptionally strong near or just ahead of the main line of thunderstorms, producing damaging winds, large hail, and a violent EF-4 tornado near Pembroke, GA that took 1 life and injured 12 others along an approximately 14.5 mile path.",50,244,,

The tornado was part of a larger mesocyclone which can be traced west all the way back to the Selma Alabama tornado which spawned numerous tornadoes during its lifecycle. This particular tornado first touched down in an area around Crouch road and Wild Plum Road snapping and uprooting trees. The tornado struck a Rinai building causing damage to the roof, windows and outside walls. The tornado continued northeast snapping and uprooting trees quickly intensifying as it crossed hwy 19 becoming and EF2. Widespread tree damage was noted along S. McDonough Road and Walnut Grove Road north of Hwy 16. A well built home sustained significant roof and structure damage consistent with high end EF2 winds. The tornado continued northeast crossing High Falls Road, N. Walkers Mill Road, Yamacraw road snapping and uprooting trees consistent with EF1 damage. As the tornado continued northeast, it became the dominant circulation within the larger mesocyclone as the previous Griffin tornado began to occlude within the large circulation. The tornado crossed Jackson road and paralleled Jenkinsburg road before crossing I75 near Jenkinsburg Road. Snapped and uprooted trees were noted along both sides of I75 where the tornado crossed. As the storm became the dominant circulation within the mesocyclone, the wind field expanded and the damage became fairly consistent with high end EF1 to low EF2 thereafter. The tornado crossed Locust Road, Dean Patrick Road and England Chapel Road were numerous trees were snapped and uprooted. Some home damage was noted in the area as well, particularly as it approached Shiloah Road. Several homes were damaged along Plaza Dr and Smith Dr. The tornado continued NE crossing Hwy 23 striking a large warehouse. Severe roof and exterior wall damage was noted as debris was spread across the highway and to the NE of the hwy. As the tornado crossed the highway it struck a train on the tracks and overturned 3 rail cars just west Walter Moore Rd. The storm continued northeast crossing Wolf Creek Road snapping and uprooting trees near several homes consistent with EF1 wind damage. The tornado continued northeast crossing Rising Star Church road and Brown road snapping and uprooting trees. As the storm continued northeast beyond this point, the remnant circulation which last produced damage near Locust Grove regenerated a new tornado a little over a mile to the northwest along Fincherville Road. The two tornadoes would continue to the NE nearly parallel through the Jackson Lake area. This particular tornado continued northeast and would intensify to EF2 as it crossed Hwy 36 north of Keys Ferry Road and Haley Road. The fatality and critical injury directly associated with this tornado occurred along Haley Road when a tree fell onto a vehicle injuring the driver and fatally wounding a passenger. EF2 damage was noted East of hwy36 along Haley Road, Pocahontas St. Chickasaw lane and several neighborhoods along the lake. The tornado crossed into Southern Newton County causing severe damage along Parker Road, Ray Road, Malcom Rd, Quarry Ct, Pebble Ridge Dr, Hunters Trace, Campbell Rd and Hwy 212 as it entered Jasper County near the Franks Restaurant. EF1 to low end EF2 damage was intermittent along Yancy Rd, Dallas Tr, Gem Lane, Lee���s Cove, Alcovy N. Dr, Rainbow Dr and County Line Road. The Bear Creek Marian was destroyed and several campers were destroyed. The storm continued NE crossing Henderson Mill Road snapping and uprooting trees, County line Trail and Hwy 11 before weakening and lifting as it approached Margery Lake. A second fatality was resulted the following day when a lineman was knocked out of a bucket truck in Jasper County after being struck by a large tree branch while attempting to restore powerlines. The fatality, is considered indirect but will be tied to this particular tornado. Widespread wind damage can be seen via areal survey and ground survey throughout northern Butts, Southern Newton and Western Jasper counties and surveying this particular storm was a challenge to discern where the tornado actually ended and where the severe wind damage started. The path width is an approximation based on the most severe damage swaths which were surveyed however, strong inflow winds occurred for much of the lifecycle of this tornado making a very wide swath of damage along its 30+ mile long path.","A line of strong thunderstorms moved into north and central Georgia during the afternoon through the evening on Thursday, January 12th and spawned numerous tornadoes, including several that were long track and significant. Ahead of this line, a few supercells also spawned tornadoes in portions of central and eastern Georgia.  Upon further examination of radar data and high resolution areal imagery, it was found that several tornadoes rotated around and within a larger vortex and caused the widespread damage in the area near Griffin GA, over 2 miles wide in some cases.  |The result was that as many as 4 tornadoes were on the ground simultaneously in SW Spalding County, which were rotating around the larger circulation, merging together in several cases and crossing paths. The presence of 3 mergers was identified in the reanalysis. Additional analysis revealed that wind speeds in the EF3 storm reached|as high as 155mph or high end EF3.

Damage to trees and roofs of several homes continued through and east of Reynolds, although the damage in this area was not as severe.","A major, negatively tilted and closed upper trough rotated through the mid-south and southeast U.S. on March 1st.  A 150kt jet was located over the region at 250mb with a strong 50kt low-level jet from central Alabama into central Tennessee.  A wedge of cool air was present over much of north central and northeast Georgia. Rain, which spread over this area early in the day, helped enhance the wedge of cool air.  Little to no severe weather was noted north of the wedge boundary across north Georgia where the air mass remained relatively cool and stable. Meanwhile...a warm, humid air mass was present across much of central and south Georgia where dewpoints had risen well into the 60s during the afternoon.  The strong upper dynamics present over this region combined with the instability just south of the wedge provided a very favorable environment for long lived, strong tornadoes.  A total of 14 tornadoes affecting 17 counties tracked across central and east central Georgia and within the Peachtree City, Georgia county warning area during the late afternoon and evening hours of March 1st.  This was the second greatest number of tornadoes recorded to have occurred in the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area within a 24-hour period, second only to the 16 tornadoes, affecting 18 counties, associated with Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005.  The March 1st tornadoes spanned an area from Stewart county in the far southwest part of the county warning area to Warren county in the far east central portion of the county warning area.  The first tornado touched down in Stewart county at 4:11 pm EST and the last tornado lifted in Marion county at 10:55 pm EST.  By far the hardest hit county was Sumter county, and especially the city of Americus, where hundreds of homes and business, including the regional hospital, were heavily damaged or destroyed.  Additional tornadoes were reported further south in Tallahassee and Jacksonville's, Florida's forecast areas.  Federal disaster assistance had been approved for 1,836 households across the state for a total of $14.2 million.  Another $5.8 million had been approved for public assistance of debris removal and to repair infrastructure.  The Small Business Association also approved $7 million in disaster assistance loans.  Overall damages, however, are estimated to be several hundred million.|Substantial rainfall fell across much of the state, but rainfall amounts of three to five inches were common across central and east central areas.

The tornado weakened to an EF2 strength before entering Walker county, and continued as an EF2 to EF1 across much of its path within Walker county.  The tornado crossed into Walker county approximately five miles west-southwest of Chattanooga Valley and lifted just west of Fort Oglethorpe near the intersection of U.S. Highway 27 and Georgia Highway 2.  Thousands of trees and dozens of power lines were taken down by the tornado.  Dozens of homes suffered severe damage, especially across the northern part of the county.   Seven homes were completely destroyed.  The most severe damage was noted in the Flintstone area.  While no fatalities occurred within Walker county, there were 25 injuries, mostly at the severely damaged or destroyed homes.  The most severe damage with this tornado occurred in Dade county.||Damage in Walker county consists of seven destroyed homes, 26 with major damage, and 35 with minor damage.||[04/27-04/28/11: Tornado #2, County #2-2, EF2, Dade-Walker, 2011:011].","A highly diffluent, deep upper trough, centered across Texas, took on a negative tilt and began to rotate northeast during this period.  A strong maritime-Pacific (mP) cold front accompanied the upper trough through the mid-south into the southeast from the early morning hours of the 27th to the early morning hours of the 28th.  An intense low-level jet with winds in excess of 70 knots was noted in advance of this system and tracked across the mid-south early on the 27th, across north Alabama and north Georgia into the early morning hours of the 28th.  West-southwest winds aloft were highly diffluent and near 200 mph across this same region.  The strong low-level jet brought unseasonably, warm, moist Gulf air northward in advance of the mP cold front.  Dewpoints in the 70s and maximum temperatures in the 80s combined with the extremely strong low-level and upper jets to create an almost perfect environment for severe thunderstorms and large devastating tornadoes.  Indeed, the tornado outbreak that affected much of the eastern U.S., but particularly the south central and southeastern U.S. during this period, was unprecedented and likely the largest recorded in U.S. history.  The tornado outbreak that accompanied this combination of weather features has been termed the 2011 Super Outbreak, an outbreak even worse than the 1994 and 1974 super tornado outbreaks across the eastern U.S.  The outbreak affected the South Central, Southeast, Midwest, and even the usually less tornado prone Northeastern United States.  Over 330 tornadoes were reported during this outbreak which began on April 25th and continued into the 28th affecting 21 states from Texas to New York.  Even isolated tornadoes were noted in Canada.  Nearly 350 people died from these tornadoes, of which over 230 of these were in Alabama alone.  Four tornadoes on April 27th in Alabama and Mississippi were ranked EF5, the highest tornado damage rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  On average, there is only one EF5 tornado per year in the entire U.S.||Widespread and destructive tornadoes occurred on each day of the outbreak, but April 27th was clearly one of the most prolific and destructive tornado days in U.S. history, probably only surpassed by the Tri-State outbreak of 1925 and the Tupelo-Gainesville outbreak of 1936.  The 24-hour period from 8 am April 27th to 8 a.m. April 28th is listed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as the fourth deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history, with the 24 hours commencing April 28th at 8 a.m. as the fifth deadliest tornado day in U.S. history.

As the storm continued north into southern Spalding County, the circulation briefly weakened causing only sporadic low end EF0 damage northward along Scott Barch Road. It should also be noted that this circulation would pass into southern Spalding County along Scott Barch Road just 2 minutes ahead of another EF1 tornado to cross its path coming in from the west. The tornado continued north crossing Scott Barch Road and uprooting trees in an area south of Blanton Mill Road. Per both radar data and damage on the ground the tornado would pivot within the larger mesocyclone in an area north of Blanton Mill and begin its track east crossing Rover Zetlla Road destroying a barn. It was near this point the tornado and the wind damage would significantly increase as the tornado was intensifying rapidly. The tornado would quickly reach peak intensity of 150-155 mph and several homes were completely destroyed along Kendall Drive and West Road. 2 homes in particular were noted to be completely destroyed down to the foundation however further inspection of the homes revealed that the walls were not anchored fully anchored into the concrete thus a higher rating could not be determined from those homes. The resident of one of those homes rode out the storm in his bathtub, however the bathtub and all plumbing fixtures were torn away from the slab and tossed into the nearby woods. The survivor of the home was miraculously uninjured and got out to help neighbors. Further west along Kendall Drive several homes were also completely destroyed with several others suffering major damage thus the EF3 rating. The damage along West Road in particular garnered a slight upgrade in the wind speed to high end EF3 damage per a reanalysis. Major to severe damage was also noted along Maloy Road, Hwy 16, areas around Griffin High School, The club at Shoal Creek and North Pine Hill Road. As the tornado approached Hwy 19, per UGA faculty, the UGA facility at Dempsey Farm recorded a wind speed of 81.1 mph before the anemometer/wind combo instrument blew off the tower. The tornado continued ENE through the community of Experiment to the NW of the town of Griffin crossing HWY 92 where numerous business and homes suffered damage either from wind or fallen trees consistent with EF0 through EF1 damage. A weather instrument on the south end of the tornado swath at the UGA Griffin Campus recorded a 73.9 mph wind gust as the storm passed by. Damage in the area was consistent with EF0 type wind damage. The tornado struck a Hobby Lobby building in an around Experiment St and Hwy 92 which suffered severe damage to the roof, and exterior walls on the northeast side. Damage to the building was consistent with EF2 winds of approximately 130 mph. The tornado continued Northeast through the northside of Griffin with mostly EF0-EF1 type wind damage. Pockets of more severe damage were noted along Northside Drive and McIntosh Road consistent with high end EF1 damage. The tornado continued northeast crossing Smoak Road and N. McDonough road where it was noted both on the ground and from the air that the circulation weakened and the damage become more sporadic in nature particularly the area from Amelia rd eastward to I75 in southern Henry County. Once the circulation crossed I75 intensity of the tornado increased to a mid to high end EF1 with damage in the city of Locust Grove. The tornado crossed LG Griffin Road where it impacted numerous homes in a subdivision and snapped or uprooted trees. The storm crossed Stanley K Tanger Road and through another neighborhood affecting several homes including some high end EF1 damage. As the storm crossed Hwy 23 numerous trees were snapped or uprooted and a new TDS appeared on radar. The tornado continued NE across Jackson St, Grove Park Drive, Skyland Dr, S. Unity Grove Road and S Ola grove road snapping and uprooting trees as well as causing EF0 or in some cases EF1 damage to homes. The storm continued ENE snapping and uprooting trees through Peaksville Road where it shortly thereafter become less defined and eventually merged with the circulation/tornado ongoing to the south in the Jenkinsburg area.","A line of strong thunderstorms moved into north and central Georgia during the afternoon through the evening on Thursday, January 12th and spawned numerous tornadoes, including several that were long track and significant. Ahead of this line, a few supercells also spawned tornadoes in portions of central and eastern Georgia.  Upon further examination of radar data and high resolution areal imagery, it was found that several tornadoes rotated around and within a larger vortex and caused the widespread damage in the area near Griffin GA, over 2 miles wide in some cases.  |The result was that as many as 4 tornadoes were on the ground simultaneously in SW Spalding County, which were rotating around the larger circulation, merging together in several cases and crossing paths. The presence of 3 mergers was identified in the reanalysis. Additional analysis revealed that wind speeds in the EF3 storm reached|as high as 155mph or high end EF3.  This confirmed a total of 14 tornadoes, including 10 which resulted from the same storm/larger mesocyclone.",110,244,,

The tornado then damaged homes and apartments along Point Peter Road. The tornado reached maximum width near the Eagle Hammock RV Park at EF1 intensity. Multiple recreational vehicles were flipped over, with two completely flipped upside down. One RV was flipped and blown about 200 yards into a lake on the north side of the park. Several hardwood trees at the park were snapped. There was debris from the RVs scattered throughout the RV park area.

A strong maritime-Pacific (mP) cold front accompanied the upper trough through the mid-south into the southeast from the early morning hours of the 27th to the early morning hours of the 28th.  An intense low-level jet with winds in excess of 70 knots was noted in advance of this system and tracked across the mid-south early on the 27th, across north Alabama and north Georgia into the early morning hours of the 28th.  West-southwest winds aloft were highly diffluent and near 200 mph across this same region.  The strong low-level jet brought unseasonably, warm, moist Gulf air northward in advance of the mP cold front.  Dewpoints in the 70s and maximum temperatures in the 80s combined with the extremely strong low-level and upper jets to create an almost perfect environment for severe thunderstorms and large devastating tornadoes.  Indeed, the tornado outbreak that affected much of the eastern U.S., but particularly the south central and southeastern U.S. during this period, was unprecedented and likely the largest recorded in U.S. history.  The tornado outbreak that accompanied this combination of weather features has been termed the 2011 Super Outbreak, an outbreak even worse than the 1994 and 1974 super tornado outbreaks across the eastern U.S.  The outbreak affected the South Central, Southeast, Midwest, and even the usually less tornado prone Northeastern United States.  Over 330 tornadoes were reported during this outbreak which began on April 25th and continued into the 28th affecting 21 states from Texas to New York.  Even isolated tornadoes were noted in Canada.  Nearly 350 people died from these tornadoes, of which over 230 of these were in Alabama alone.  Four tornadoes on April 27th in Alabama and Mississippi were ranked EF5, the highest tornado damage rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  On average, there is only one EF5 tornado per year in the entire U.S.||Widespread and destructive tornadoes occurred on each day of the outbreak, but April 27th was clearly one of the most prolific and destructive tornado days in U.S. history, probably only surpassed by the Tri-State outbreak of 1925 and the Tupelo-Gainesville outbreak of 1936.  The 24-hour period from 8 am April 27th to 8 a.m. April 28th is listed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as the fourth deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history, with the 24 hours commencing April 28th at 8 a.m. as the fifth deadliest tornado day in U.S. history.  It has also been determined to be the costliest tornado outbreaks and one of the costliest natural disasters in the U.S., even after adjustments for inflation, with total damages estimated to exceed $10 billion. ||Georgia was heavily impacted by this tornado outbreak, especially the northwest part of the state which bore the brunt of the massive supercell thunderstorms producing killer tornadoes that tracked east-northeast from northern Alabama during the late evening.  All together, there were 15 tornadoes affecting 28 counties within the Peachtree City, Georgia 96-county warning area (CWA) of North and Central Georgia.  All of these occurred within a 24-hour period commencing at 8 am April 27th.  One of these tornadoes was rated an EF4, the first EF4 tornado in Georgia since the Palm Sunday outbreak in 1994.  In addition, there were also four EF3 tornadoes.  Fifteen tornado-related deaths were observed in north and central Georgia, the most tornado-related deaths within the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area since its inception in 1994.  The previous highest tornado-related death total was 12 on March 20, 1998, when a tornado struck Gainesville, Georgia.||Finally, it should be noted that while the most significant period of severe weather during this outbreak for Georgia was from the afternoon of the 27th through the early morning hours of the 28th, there was an initial round of severe weather across northwest Georgia early on the 27th as a decaying line of severe thunderstorms moved into the region from northeast Alabama.  Widespread wind damage and even a few brief weaker tornadoes accompanied this system into the northwest counties of the state.",140,244,,

The tornado crossed just across the border into Muscogee county before lifting.  Moderate damage was observed within the Main Post area of Fort Benning along a 150-yard wide, 1.5-mile long path.  The majority of the damage occurred along Wold Avenue, where about 10 World War II warehouses were heavily damage, and 18-wheel truck was flipped over, and two vehicles were damaged from debris.  Several trees and power lines were also down in the area.  Six homes were also damaged in the McDonald Manor Housing Area from large downed trees and limbs.  Nine minor injuries were reported in this area as a result of flying or falling debris.","A very deep closed upper low moved through the mid and deep south resulting in a significant severe weather outbreak across the deep south and southeast.  Georgia was on the eastern edge of this outbreak because much of north and central Georgia remained in a wedge of cooler air.  However, a nose of warm, moist air from central and southern Alabama worked its way into the Columbus area of west central Georgia.  Dewpoints in the Columbus area rose into the lower 60s helping to fuel the environment in that region for strong storms.   A strong squall line of thunderstorms from central and southern Alabama worked its way into west central Georgia shortly after noon, spawning a tornado in the Fort Benning area.  The line of thunderstorms weakened considerably as it moved further east into the cooler, more stable air.  Thus, little severe weather was reported further east.|In addition to the severe weather, rainfall of two to four inches across much of north and west Georgia resulted in several street flooding incidents, especially in the Columbus area.

The tornado exited Crawford county about 5.5 miles east of Sandy Point or about 9 miles east-northeast of Knoxville.  The tornado traveled over six miles in Crawford county, but the path length of the entire track was approximately 8.5 miles long with a maximum path width of one-quarter mile.  Significant damage was noted along the path of the tornado, especially along Sandy Point Road in northeast Crawford county.  Here, several homes and outbuildings were heavily damaged or destroyed.  Numerous trees were either snapped or uprooted.  Nine injuries were reported in the area of the damaged homes.","A major, negatively tilted and closed upper trough rotated through the mid-south and southeast U.S. on March 1st.  A 150kt jet was located over the region at 250mb with a strong 50kt low-level jet from central Alabama into central Tennessee.  A wedge of cool air was present over much of north central and northeast Georgia. Rain, which spread over this area early in the day, helped enhance the wedge of cool air.  Little to no severe weather was noted north of the wedge boundary across north Georgia where the air mass remained relatively cool and stable. Meanwhile...a warm, humid air mass was present across much of central and south Georgia where dewpoints had risen well into the 60s during the afternoon.  The strong upper dynamics present over this region combined with the instability just south of the wedge provided a very favorable environment for long lived, strong tornadoes.  A total of 14 tornadoes affecting 17 counties tracked across central and east central Georgia and within the Peachtree City, Georgia county warning area during the late afternoon and evening hours of March 1st.  This was the second greatest number of tornadoes recorded to have occurred in the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area within a 24-hour period, second only to the 16 tornadoes, affecting 18 counties, associated with Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005.  The March 1st tornadoes spanned an area from Stewart county in the far southwest part of the county warning area to Warren county in the far east central portion of the county warning area.  The first tornado touched down in Stewart county at 4:11 pm EST and the last tornado lifted in Marion county at 10:55 pm EST.  By far the hardest hit county was Sumter county, and especially the city of Americus, where hundreds of homes and business, including the regional hospital, were heavily damaged or destroyed.  Additional tornadoes were reported further south in Tallahassee and Jacksonville's, Florida's forecast areas.  Federal disaster assistance had been approved for 1,836 households across the state for a total of $14.2 million.  Another $5.8 million had been approved for public assistance of debris removal and to repair infrastructure.  The Small Business Association also approved $7 million in disaster assistance loans.  Overall damages, however, are estimated to be several hundred million.|Substantial rainfall fell across much of the state, but rainfall amounts of three to five inches were common across central and east central areas.

The Tornado beginning and end times are based on radar data combined with credible ground truth reports. ||The Tornado formed at 952 am, approximately 3 miles northwest of Darien, Georgia and tracked east about 11 miles before dissipating at 1007 am as a water spout in Doboy Sound. ||The Tornado formed in a wooded area about a half mile west of Route 251 where numerous trees were snapped off. The Tornado strengthened rapidly as it approached and moved across Route 251.||The Tornado struck a Marine Sales and Services Business located on the east side of Route 251. The bolts for all but one of the anchored metal support beams for the metal building were snapped off just above the concrete slab. With the exception of the one metal support beam that was bent to the ground, the slab was wiped clean. Approximately 50 boats were tossed around and destroyed, with one 18 foot 4000 pound boast carried about 650 yards into some trees. A 32 foot 8000 pound boat was carried about 130 yards onto the top of the Gateway Behavioral Services Building. A vehicle that was parked in the parking lot was carried in the air 150 yards. One 125 horsepower boat motor weighing 300 to 350 pounds was carried 250 yards and deposited into the roof of a building. In addition, one of the boats had yet to be accounted for at the time the survey was conducted. Several other vehicles near the business were rolled or tossed and severely damaged or destroyed. No one was in the building at the time the Tornado struck and damage to the building and all the boats were estimated to be 5 million dollars.||Approximately 100 yards to the south-southeast of the Marine Sales and Services Building, the McIntosh Emergency Medical Services Building was destroyed by the Tornado with damage to three ambulances and one fire truck. Many of the metal support beams from this facility were torn from the concrete slab or snapped off. This building was rated for 120 mph winds. No one was in this building at the time of the Tornado because they were out on a non weather related call.||The Gateway Behavioral Health and Services Building was totally destroyed. This metal framed building with brick exterior was located about 100 yards east-northeast of the McIntosh Emergency Medical Services Building and 130 yards east-southeast of the Marine Sales and Services Building. The roof of the Gateway Building collapsed along with many of the outer brick walls. Many of the large load bearing metal beams were bent or knocked down. Portions of the metal roof were carried a mile away onto Interstate 95. Some of the roofing material was found 11 miles away on Sapelo Island. Of the 12 people that were in the building when the Tornado hit, 9 were injured sustaining broken bones and or lacerations. Six vehicles around this building were damaged or destroyed and a metal light pole and several trees were snapped off in this area. ||Two other businesses in this area suffered damage including damage to satellite dishes and two overturned tractor trailers. Damage to the Marine Sales and Services Business and the Gateway Behavioral Health and Services Building indicated that EF-4 damage had occurred with winds estimated to be between 170 and 180 mph. ||After leaving this area the Tornado traveled east and weakened. The Tornado reached its maximum width of 700 yards as it crossed Interstate 95, and then decreased in size and was mainly from 200 to 500 yards wide during the remainder of the path. The Tornado damaged or destroyed four billboards along Interstate 95, produced mainly minor roof damage to several dozen homes mainly in the Ridgeville area, snapped off or uprooted thousands of trees, some of them falling on homes or vehicles, and damaged or destroyed numerous outbuildings. ||A resident of Ridgeville, Georgia whose home suffered minor damage in the Tornado, took shelter in a closet after seeing a National Weather Service Severe Weather Statement on the television mentioning that Ridgeville was in the path of the Tornado. ||The Tornado also damaged the Blue-N-Hall Marina and Fishing Dock. In this area, a large boat hoist along with 18 boats and several boat trailers were damaged or destroyed. Several power poles were also snapped off and several vehicles were damaged. Numerous trees were also snapped off on Hird Island. The Tornado likely dissipated over Doboy Sound as a waterspout. Besides portions of the Gateway roof, lots of other debris including signs were deposited on Sapelo Island.","A warm front lifted northward through southern South Carolina and southeast Georgia during the morning, with a strong cold front then sweeping through the area during the evening.

Some of the most severe damage was near the beginning of the track as the tornado impacted Langdale Forest Products along Old  Clyattville Road. Several large metal buildings were severely damaged or destroyed and the damage to those buildings was assigned the EF2 rating that is the maximum for this tornado. Some vehicles parked near those buildings were tossed around 70 yards across the street. Two rail cars nearby were also tipped over. The remainder of the track consisted of EF0 or EF1 damage as the tornado moved east and eventually dissipated near south Patterson Street and Dampier Street. That damage in the remainder of the track was a mixture of damage to buildings, trees, and power lines.  Monetary damage was estimated.||This was the first tornado to directly affect the city of Valdosta since an F1-rated tornado on November 1, 1997.","A band of light to moderate rain was moving across the area on December 29th in association with a surface cold front. Along the leading edge of the area of rain, a shallow, mini-supercell developed and moved into Lowndes County, Georgia. No lightning was observed with the cell; the tops of the showers were generally below 15,000 feet. As the cell moved over Valdosta, a brief tornado spun up and produced damage up to EF2 intensity on the south side of Valdosta. This was the first tornado to directly affect the city of Valdosta since 1997.||This was an unusual case as atmospheric conditions were not very favorable, though not totally prohibitive, for significant tornadoes.

The tornado tracked east-southeast approximately 9 miles southeast of Brooklet, GA to Pineora, GA. ||The tornado began near Stillson Leefield Road, in Bulloch County, GA. Most of the damage within the first few miles of the event was due to many snapped and uprooted trees. ||The most significant damage occurred near the center of the path, in an area just west of South Old River Road to near Terrell Road, in Bulloch County, GA. There were several mobile homes along this portion of the path that were either completely destroyed, or severely damaged. The extent of damage to the mobile homes was the reason for the high end EF2 rating with estimated maximum wind speeds up to 130 mph. Two mobile homes just north of Little Hagan Road were completely destroyed, being flipped and tossed 30 to 40 feet from their foundations. One of the mobile homes in this area was not occupied, but the other one had five people inside, plus pets. All five were injured, one seriously, with broken bones in their neck. Two pets in the same mobile home survived, but one died from its injuries. There was also a car pushed 20 to 30 feet and a large metal trucking container, weighing approximately 9,000 pounds, pushed about 50 feet. ||Continuing about 200 yards southeast along the path, a single family home sustained moderate damage, mainly from projectiles and debris hitting it from the mobile homes upstream. A large carport/overhang was completely torn from the home, which then |fell on and damaged 3 cars. A large hole was punched through the north wall of the home from debris hitting the window and pushing into the home. Otherwise, some minor shingle damage was observed, with 20-30% of the shingles missing.||Another 200 yards southeast of this home was another mobile home that was severely damaged. It was lifted and rolled 30 to 40 feet off of its foundation, crushing 2 cars before coming to rest on the edge of a bluff. There were 2 people severely injured in this home with one pet injured.||The tornado then continued across the Ogeechee River into Effingham County.","Strongly forced, organized convection ahead of a vigorous upper trough and associated cold front advanced into a marginally unstable environment featuring strong winds and wind shear.

This tornado was an EF2, had a maximum path width of 1/4 mile, with maximum winds estimated to be 120 mph.  The tornado did cross Interstate-185 east of LaGrange.  Fifteen homes were destroyed along the path of the tornado and another 50 homes sustained minor to moderate damage.  The most significant damage occurred along Georgia Highway 219 and Murphy Road near the beginning of the tornado's path, or about two miles south of the LaGrange city limits.  About 12 homes were destroyed in this area.  One home in this neighborhood was picked up and thrown 50 feet while its sun room was thrown 300 yards.  A well built log cabin on a hillside was completely destroyed as it was blown off its foundation in the opposite direction of the tornado's movement.   While no fatalities occurred admist all of this damage, there were six injuries resulting from debris and damaged homes.  Thousands of trees and many power lines were also down along the path of the tornado.||A total of 41 residential or commercial structures in Troup county were either destroyed, suffered major damage, or sustained minor to moderate damage from the two tornadoes this evening.||It should be noted that the same thunderstorm that spawned this tornado continued on to spawn yet another tornado that tracked across northeast Meriwether into western Spalding and southern Henry county shortly after this event and then later spawned additional tornadoes in east central Georgia as the night continued.||[04/27-04/28/11: Tornado #9, County #1-1, EF2, Troup, 2011:018].","A highly diffluent, deep upper trough, centered across Texas, took on a negative tilt and began to rotate northeast during this period.  A strong maritime-Pacific (mP) cold front accompanied the upper trough through the mid-south into the southeast from the early morning hours of the 27th to the early morning hours of the 28th.  An intense low-level jet with winds in excess of 70 knots was noted in advance of this system and tracked across the mid-south early on the 27th, across north Alabama and north Georgia into the early morning hours of the 28th.  West-southwest winds aloft were highly diffluent and near 200 mph across this same region.  The strong low-level jet brought unseasonably, warm, moist Gulf air northward in advance of the mP cold front.  Dewpoints in the 70s and maximum temperatures in the 80s combined with the extremely strong low-level and upper jets to create an almost perfect environment for severe thunderstorms and large devastating tornadoes.  Indeed, the tornado outbreak that affected much of the eastern U.S., but particularly the south central and southeastern U.S. during this period, was unprecedented and likely the largest recorded in U.S. history.  The tornado outbreak that accompanied this combination of weather features has been termed the 2011 Super Outbreak, an outbreak even worse than the 1994 and 1974 super tornado outbreaks across the eastern U.S.  The outbreak affected the South Central, Southeast, Midwest, and even the usually less tornado prone Northeastern United States.  Over 330 tornadoes were reported during this outbreak which began on April 25th and continued into the 28th affecting 21 states from Texas to New York.  Even isolated tornadoes were noted in Canada.  Nearly 350 people died from these tornadoes, of which over 230 of these were in Alabama alone.  Four tornadoes on April 27th in Alabama and Mississippi were ranked EF5, the highest tornado damage rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  On average, there is only one EF5 tornado per year in the entire U.S.||Widespread and destructive tornadoes occurred on each day of the outbreak, but April 27th was clearly one of the most prolific and destructive tornado days in U.S. history, probably only surpassed by the Tri-State outbreak of 1925 and the Tupelo-Gainesville outbreak of 1936.  The 24-hour period from 8 am April 27th to 8 a.m. April 28th is listed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as the fourth deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history, with the 24 hours commencing April 28th at 8 a.m. as the fifth deadliest tornado day in U.S. history.  It has also been determined to be the costliest tornado outbreaks and one of the costliest natural disasters in the U.S., even after adjustments for inflation, with total damages estimated to exceed $10 billion. ||Georgia was heavily impacted by this tornado outbreak, especially the northwest part of the state which bore the brunt of the massive supercell thunderstorms producing killer tornadoes that tracked east-northeast from northern Alabama during the late evening.  All together, there were 15 tornadoes affecting 28 counties within the Peachtree City, Georgia 96-county warning area (CWA) of North and Central Georgia.  All of these occurred within a 24-hour period commencing at 8 am April 27th.  One of these tornadoes was rated an EF4, the first EF4 tornado in Georgia since the Palm Sunday outbreak in 1994.  In addition, there were also four EF3 tornadoes.  Fifteen tornado-related deaths were observed in north and central Georgia, the most tornado-related deaths within the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area since its inception in 1994.  The previous highest tornado-related death total was 12 on March 20, 1998, when a tornado struck Gainesville, Georgia.||Finally, it should be noted that while the most significant period of severe weather during this outbreak for Georgia was from the afternoon of the 27th through the early morning hours of the 28th, there was an initial round of severe weather across northwest Georgia early on the 27th as a decaying line of severe thunderstorms moved into the region from northeast Alabama.  Widespread wind damage and even a few brief weaker tornadoes accompanied this system into the northwest counties of the state.",182,244,,

This tornado was a quarter mile wide at its widest point when it crossed Ebenezer Road and had maximum sustained winds estimated between 110 and 120 mph.","A large and intense area of low pressure lifted northward through the central Appalachians, dragging a strong cold front toward southern South Carolina and southeast Georgia. The combination of the approaching cold front along with strong dynamic forcing and plenty of instability resulted in a widespread organized severe weather outbreak across the region.",198,244,,

Dozen of mobile and site-built homes in Wrightsville sustained minor to moderate damage as a result of this tornado, some of which were destroyed.  Five injuries were reported from mobile homes destroyed with this tornado.  An additional indirect injury resulted when a tree fell on an individual during debris clean up.  In addition, numerous trees and power lines were downed along the path of the tornado through western Johnson county.  The overall tornado path length was 10 miles, of which nearly nine occurred within Johnson county.  The maximum path width was estimated to be up to 1/3 mile wide.||Within Johnson county, 227 homes were damaged, 22 of which were destroyed and 67 of which sustained major damage.  Six public buildings also sustained minor to moderate damage.  In addition, a total of five injuries were reported as a result of this tornado, four of which occurred as a result of damaged or destroyed mobile homes.  The Georgia Forestry Commission reported extensive loss to timber within Johnson county when the tornado destroyed several hundred pine trees.","A stationary front was draped across north Georgia early on May 10th with an active northwest flow aloft.  Meanwhile...a vigorous short wave aloft was approaching the area from the southern plains.  The stationary front provided the focus for two rounds of showers and thunderstorms, one early in the morning on the 10th and another in the afternoon.  The activity tracked east-southeast with the upper flow aloft, mainly across north Georgia during the early morning and across central Georgia during the afternoon.  An isolated strong supercell also tracked across the southern part of central Georgia during the evening.  After a lull of convective activity for about four hours, intense multicell thunderstorms tracked into the area from Alabama after midnight and before dawn on the 11th.  As these thunderstorms tracked across west central and central Georgia, 15 tornadoes were identified by subsequent surveys making this the most significant tornado outbreak to affect the area since the Katrina-associated tornadoes on August 29, 2005.  Millions of dollars of property damage were reported as many homes were destroyed from these tornadoes from the western and southern suburbs of Atlanta southeastward across Macon, Dublin, and other counties in east central and southeast Georgia.  Many of these counties were eligible for disaster assistance from the federal government.||In addition to the tornadoes and thunderstorm winds that caused extensive damage in dozens of counties across north and central Georgia during the early morning hours of May 11th, strong gradient winds developed on the back side of the strong cold front that moved through the area as low pressure intensified across the mid-Atlantic region.  The strong winds combined with wet ground resulted in dozens of trees being blown down in some north Georgia counties.  There were also two deaths as a result of downed trees in Barrow and Gwinnett county, all non-thunderstorm-related winds.",199,244,,

The tornado then continued on a continuous path for nearly 16 miles across much of northwestern Calhoun County. Initial damage northwest of Edison, GA in northwestern Calhoun County was largely limited to downed or snapped trees. As the tornado neared Georgia Highway 216, there was an area of more concentrated damage along Magnolia Road. Two single wide mobile homes were destroyed at this location along with numerous snapped pine trees. Damage in this area was consistent with EF-1 damage or a maximum wind of around 100-105 mph. For the following four miles of the track, damage was once again limited to mostly downed or snapped trees. More significant damage occurred east of the Ichawaynochaway Creek north of Georgia Highway 37 near Dickey, GA. On Country Club Road, a single family residence was damaged, with a portion of the exterior brick wall collapsed, large sections of the roof removed, and debris blown 100-200 yards from the structure. Large trees near the residence were uprooted or snapped. Across the road, a double wide mobile home had some sections of walls and roof removed, and it was blown off its foundation by a couple feet. Additional large, healthy trees were snapped and uprooted at that location. Damage in this area was consistent with high end EF-1 to low end EF-2 damage, with a maximum wind of 110-120 mph. Even more significant damage occurred further east along the Dickey Bypass. Numerous trees in this area were snapped and uprooted. Along the south side of the road, a double-wide mobile home was completely obliterated with debris blown across the road about 50 yards or more into a tree line. This mobile home was strapped and anchored to the ground in several locations, with the anchors sticking into the ground approximately a foot. The mobile home frame separated completely and wrapped around a nearby tree. Numerous hardwood trees near the home were snapped. Damage at this location was the most intense along the track of this tornado and was consistent with strong EF-2 damage, with a maximum wind of 125 to 130 mph. Analysis of the damage patterns suggests that this mobile home may have been hit by a subvortex in the tornado, as debris was blown across the path of the tornado to the north. Most of the debris along the rest of the path tended to be blown in a more easterly direction. Just to the east of that residence, another house was damaged, with a small portion of the roof removed. The residents stated that the roof had separated from the walls, but set down again in a slightly different location. Almost all the pine trees near this house were snapped. The tree damage continued to the east for about another mile, with a medium sized shed or outbuilding also destroyed near the end of the tornado path.  Total damage cost was estimated.","Although most of the severe weather during the late night to early morning hours of April 6-7 stayed north of the tri-state area, an isolated storm did produce an EF2 tornado across Calhoun county with some injuries reported.",200,244,,

The tornado began near the intersection of Seaboard Coastline Drive and Telfair Road. At this location, damage was mainly limited to some snapped trees and minor wind damage to the bottom skirts of some mobile office trailers. The tornado continued northward with the next damage area along Alfred Street, just east of Market Street. At this location there were some snapped trees and minor damage to the wall of one home, which was partially blown down, causing the garage door to blow out. From this point, the tornado moved northward producing sporadic, non-continuous damage. About one third of a metal roof of an industrial building just north of Market Street was damaged. Next, the tornado moved toward the more industrial and commercial area just south of Highway 80, where it did significant damage to an Advanced Auto Parts store. Three walls collapsed and the roof was heavily damaged and shifted halfway off the remaining rear wall. At this point, the tornado had its strongest winds, estimated to be around 110 mph. The rating was capped at a high end EF1 due to the lack of damage or much less significant damage to structures immediately around the store. There were also five people injured inside the Advanced Auto Parts store, and at least 5 cars were heavily damaged from the front wall of the store falling on them. The tornado continued to do very sporadic and more minor damage as it moved north of Highway 21, finally terminating at the Port of Savannah-Garden City. At the port, it pushed over some shipping containers and did minor damage to some container tanks in the area. The tornado then moved into the Savannah River and dissipated.","A strong line of thunderstorms developed in the afternoon hours well ahead of a cold front to the west.

Along Highway 45 the tornado snapped a few trees and damaged the roofs of a couple of houses. The tornado crossed the highway moving northeast and reached peak intensity as it hit homes along Killebrew Rd. Two homes and a detached garage along Killebrew Rd were destroyed down to their foundations, which were not anchored. One home was constructed of concrete block which collapsed. The other home was constructed of wood with a concrete block foundation. The 5 injuries noted came from these two homes. A truck was tossed from the detached garage and onto the homes. Several trees were uprooted and snapped, with other cars sustaining heavy damage. A large tree was uprooted behind the homes and thrown about 100 yards into the front yard. Two instances were noted of small metal pole projectiles lodged into trees. Another house nearby sustained heavy damage to the roof and had portions of the exterior walls fail. A propane gas tank was dislodged and moved at this location as well. Powerlines were knocked down and most trees were snapped or uprooted along this section of the path. After the tornado crossed Killebrew Rd, it headed northeast and appeared to weaken. Trees snapped and uprooted were observed along the rest of the track along Po Boy Lane, Pullen Rd, GA Highway 200, Big Pond Rd, County Rd 3, Billy Newberry Rd, County Rd 119, Patmos Milford Hwy, and Julia Jones Rd. Damage sustained in these areas were mostly tree damage along with a couple instances of minor roof damage. The tornado lifted in Baker County after crossing Julia Jones Rd. The tornado was rated as a high end EF2 with max estimated winds around 130 mph.","A strong cold front moved through the area during the afternoon hours of Feb 15th.  The airmass ahead of the front was relatively unstable, and shear was very strong.

A strong maritime-Pacific (mP) cold front accompanied the upper trough through the mid-south into the southeast from the early morning hours of the 27th to the early morning hours of the 28th.  An intense low-level jet with winds in excess of 70 knots was noted in advance of this system and tracked across the mid-south early on the 27th, across north Alabama and north Georgia into the early morning hours of the 28th.  West-southwest winds aloft were highly diffluent and near 200 mph across this same region.  The strong low-level jet brought unseasonably, warm, moist Gulf air northward in advance of the mP cold front.  Dewpoints in the 70s and maximum temperatures in the 80s combined with the extremely strong low-level and upper jets to create an almost perfect environment for severe thunderstorms and large devastating tornadoes.  Indeed, the tornado outbreak that affected much of the eastern U.S., but particularly the south central and southeastern U.S. during this period, was unprecedented and likely the largest recorded in U.S. history.  The tornado outbreak that accompanied this combination of weather features has been termed the 2011 Super Outbreak, an outbreak even worse than the 1994 and 1974 super tornado outbreaks across the eastern U.S.  The outbreak affected the South Central, Southeast, Midwest, and even the usually less tornado prone Northeastern United States.  Over 330 tornadoes were reported during this outbreak which began on April 25th and continued into the 28th affecting 21 states from Texas to New York.  Even isolated tornadoes were noted in Canada.  Nearly 350 people died from these tornadoes, of which over 230 of these were in Alabama alone.  Four tornadoes on April 27th in Alabama and Mississippi were ranked EF5, the highest tornado damage rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  On average, there is only one EF5 tornado per year in the entire U.S.||Widespread and destructive tornadoes occurred on each day of the outbreak, but April 27th was clearly one of the most prolific and destructive tornado days in U.S. history, probably only surpassed by the Tri-State outbreak of 1925 and the Tupelo-Gainesville outbreak of 1936.  The 24-hour period from 8 am April 27th to 8 a.m. April 28th is listed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as the fourth deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history, with the 24 hours commencing April 28th at 8 a.m. as the fifth deadliest tornado day in U.S. history.  It has also been determined to be the costliest tornado outbreaks and one of the costliest natural disasters in the U.S., even after adjustments for inflation, with total damages estimated to exceed $10 billion. ||Georgia was heavily impacted by this tornado outbreak, especially the northwest part of the state which bore the brunt of the massive supercell thunderstorms producing killer tornadoes that tracked east-northeast from northern Alabama during the late evening.  All together, there were 15 tornadoes affecting 28 counties within the Peachtree City, Georgia 96-county warning area (CWA) of North and Central Georgia.  All of these occurred within a 24-hour period commencing at 8 am April 27th.  One of these tornadoes was rated an EF4, the first EF4 tornado in Georgia since the Palm Sunday outbreak in 1994.  In addition, there were also four EF3 tornadoes.  Fifteen tornado-related deaths were observed in north and central Georgia, the most tornado-related deaths within the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area since its inception in 1994.  The previous highest tornado-related death total was 12 on March 20, 1998, when a tornado struck Gainesville, Georgia.||Finally, it should be noted that while the most significant period of severe weather during this outbreak for Georgia was from the afternoon of the 27th through the early morning hours of the 28th, there was an initial round of severe weather across northwest Georgia early on the 27th as a decaying line of severe thunderstorms moved into the region from northeast Alabama.

As the tornado strengthened to an EF3 near the corner of Boone Ford Road and Beason Road just south of Calhoun, were several additional homes were damaged and one was completely destroyed.  Numerous trees and power lines were also down along the path of the tornado through Gordon county, including several blocking Interstate-75 near the Bartow county line.  Four injuries were also reported from the destroyed home.||[12/22/11:  Tornado #2, County #3-3, EF3, Floyd-Bartow-Gordon, 2011:028].","A deep trough, quite characteristic of the early winter season of 2011-2012, was anchored across the southwest U.S. with broad southwest flow aloft evident from the southwest U.S. toward the mid-Atlantic.  A summer-like Bermuda high pressure area was anchored off the southeast U.S. coast.  A stationary front extended across the lower Mississippi valley toward the mid-Atlantic with a cold front approaching from the west of this region from Texas toward the Great lakes.  The air mass across the region in advance of the stationary front was extremely moist, warm, and unstable for mid-December.  As an embedded strong short wave traversed the region in the southwest flow aloft, a period of strong shear and marginal instability translated across the region during the late afternoon and early evening.  These synoptic features supported a strong to severe quasi-linear convective system, or squall line, which moved across the state from west to east during the late afternoon and evening.  The line of thunderstorms spawned a half-a-dozen tornadoes causing extensive damage across several counties from west central into northwest and north central Georgia.  As the line moved east past Atlanta, it weakened considerably and no further severe weather was observed across east Georgia.  The six tornadoes occurring on this date tied the record for the most tornadoes ever occurring during December within the Peachtree City, Georgia county warning area in December, namely six in 2005.",221,244,,

As the tornado went across an open |field near the Old Hawkinsville Road and Cullen Road intersection,|two large high-tension transmission (power) towers were destroyed|and another large concrete power pole was snapped near its base. |Winds between 135 and 155 mph are a typical maximum wind-load |range for these electric towers/poles, supporting the rapidly |developing, now strong (EF2+) tornado. ||The tornado crossed the open field and did significant damage to |multiple homes. The first house had large sections of its roof and|second floor removed/torn away, along with numerous large trees |surrounding the property snapped near their bases. Not more than |150 yards away (to the northeast), two additional homes were hit |hard, with one completely destroyed. The damage around these areas|was consistent with EF2 to EF3 rating, with max winds approaching|160 MPH.||Less than 2 minutes later, the powerful tornado hit the south |side of Stathams Landing (neighborhood) where multiple homes had |minor to significant damage, particularly along Fairways Drive up |to Fifth Fairway. The worst of the damage in these locations |occurred at several homes along Fairways Drive were parts of the |roof and second story were destroyed, in addition to numerous |large trees snapped and uprooted around the properties. |Thankfully, the tornado appeared to have weakened slightly here, |but EF1 to low-end EF2 damage still was noted. Beyond Fifth |Fairway (street) is just open field/marsh area before Sandy Run |Creek and the county line. Little additional damage occurred here |and this drastic weakening of the tornado was supported by radar |as well. [4/5/22: Tornado #8, County #1/1, EF-3, Houston, 2022:011].","A multi-day severe weather outbreak initiated with a warm moist air mass situated over Georgia as a strengthening upper level system pushed across central Georgia. With moderate instability in place with increased shear, combined to create numerous severe thunderstorms, taking the form of a quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) with several strong supercells ahead of the front.  The resulting front stalled across central Georgia and interacted with a weaker shortwave moving up from the Gulf of Mexico, serving as a catalyst for another day of severe weather and flash flooding on April 6th.",262,244,,

Additionally, at this location, a brick cider block structure had one wall knocked over. The tornado then moved into a dairy just west of the intersection of State Road 15 and Wireglass Road. The event was rated as an EF-2 with winds of 135 mph at this location. Three metal building structures were destroyed with one removed from its foundation and blown into a pile of scrap metal. It is possible the funnel may have approached EF-3 at this particular location with winds of 140 to 150 mph; however, other damage to frame and masonry structures at the dairy suggested a lower wind value should be assigned to this area. One individual escaped injury by jumping into a depressed area inside one of the structures before it blew down around her. East of State Road 15, along Wireglass Road, extensive tree blow down and snapping continued in a tree farm. Once again the funnel likely lifted off the ground touching down again at 1430EST near 4230 Antioch Church Road destroying a doublewide mobile home.

The forecast area was under the favorable right entrance region of the upper jet with lots of upper level divergence. An 850 mb jet near or in excess of 50 knots was also present, which is another typical ingredient for severe weather in this part of the country in the cool season. Cool season levels of shear (0-1 km shear > 30 knots and 0-6 km shear > 50 knots) were overlaid with moderate levels of instability (SBCAPE  1500 j/kg), as opposed to more typical winter SBCAPE < 500 j/kg. Without this strong low-level jet, the low-level shear values would have been weaker and we would have probably seen less tornadoes.",332,244,,

A wedge of cool air was present over much of north central and northeast Georgia. Rain, which spread over this area early in the day, helped enhance the wedge of cool air.  Little to no severe weather was noted north of the wedge boundary across north Georgia where the air mass remained relatively cool and stable. Meanwhile...a warm, humid air mass was present across much of central and south Georgia where dewpoints had risen well into the 60s during the afternoon.  The strong upper dynamics present over this region combined with the instability just south of the wedge provided a very favorable environment for long lived, strong tornadoes.  A total of 14 tornadoes affecting 17 counties tracked across central and east central Georgia and within the Peachtree City, Georgia county warning area during the late afternoon and evening hours of March 1st.  This was the second greatest number of tornadoes recorded to have occurred in the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area within a 24-hour period, second only to the 16 tornadoes, affecting 18 counties, associated with Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005.  The March 1st tornadoes spanned an area from Stewart county in the far southwest part of the county warning area to Warren county in the far east central portion of the county warning area.  The first tornado touched down in Stewart county at 4:11 pm EST and the last tornado lifted in Marion county at 10:55 pm EST.  By far the hardest hit county was Sumter county, and especially the city of Americus, where hundreds of homes and business, including the regional hospital, were heavily damaged or destroyed.

This occurred during the late few days of August.  The system slowly intensified under weak steering currents and moved onshore the Louisiana coast on the 3rd.  Tropical Storm Lee was extremely slow moving at this point and consequently dumped excessive rainfall across southeast Louisiana.  A sharp upper trough began to take shape in the central U.S. on September 4th as upper energy dug southeast from Canada.  As this occurred, the remnants of Lee began to accelerate northeastward in association with the advancing upper trough.  The remnants of Lee traveled very quickly along the advancing front, racing across Georgia on the 5th.  Rain bands began to affect the area late on the 4th, but most of these were light to moderate.  On the 5th, persistent heavy rain impacted northwest Georgia and resulted in minor flooding.  Despite widespread rainfall of four to five inches across northwest Georgia with localized six to eight inches, the ongoing drought across the state resulted in minimal impacts of the heavy rain on the area,  The bigger problems came during the afternoon of the 5th when an area of strong shear, associated with the remnants of Lee, tracked from southwest to northeast across the area.  This combined with an unstable atmosphere as breaks in the clouds allowed temperatures to warm into the lower 80s.  Numerous strong thunderstorm cells developed quickly and tracked first from the Columbus area and west central Georgia into northeast Georgia.  Strong mesocyclones were indicated in many of these cells and prompted dozens of tornado warnings.

This tornado first touched down along Potts Cemetery Road downing a few trees continuing NE crossing Hwy 41 and Ingram Rd snapping and|uprooting a few trees. This portion of the track was rated EF-0. The tornado intensified quickly NE of Hwy 41 into an EF-3 as it approached Goodwyne/Collier Rd. A large 100'x150' metal building and small home were completely destroyed. The metal frame and 3'x3'x3' concrete footers for the building were all pulled from the ground with the building and twisted amongst the wreckage leaving holes in the ground around the concrete slab. Several cars were flipped and thrown including a jeep which was thrown onto the small home which sat next to the metal building. The homeowner was inside his home in the bathroom sheltering and survived under the a large pile of debris from both the house and building. Rescue operations took 45 minutes to get to the homeowner under the debris. A small plane was destroyed, a mid-size tractor was |flipped over and a boat was thrown from the tornado at this location. High end EF1/EF2 Tree damage occurred in the area to the surrounding and to the NE of the building. As the Tornado continued NE along Collier Rd, numerous trees were snapped and |uprooted including a large tree onto a home near Collier and Smith Rd. The tornado crossed Interstate 75 near mile marker 188 throwing numerous trees onto the highway shutting it down for a period of time until they were cleared. By this point, the tornado|intensity decreased to EF0/EF1 and continued NE crossing English Rd downing trees and eventually Hwy 42 before weakening. NWS Radar imagery suggests debris was lofted to as high as 19,000 FT from this particular tornado.
